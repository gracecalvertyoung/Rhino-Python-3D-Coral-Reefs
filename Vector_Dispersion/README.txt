k.py
k_helper.3dm

Rhino Python script for computing vector dispersion on 2 x 2 m mesh. A user must first copy-and-paste the template from k_helper.3dm., and then they run the script from Rhino with the command ``RunPythonScript." 

ASSUMPTIONS: 
*Reef mesh positioned with one corner of the quadrat at the origin, aligned with the positive X and Y-axes. 
*The “Top” plane is the construction plane. 
*Model units are meters. 

Values of vector dispersion will print in the Rhino command screen. They can be copied from here into a spreadsheet.
