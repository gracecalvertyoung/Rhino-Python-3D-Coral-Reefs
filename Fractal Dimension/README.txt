FD.py

Rhino Python script for computing fractal dimension on 2 x 2 m mesh. A user can run the script from Rhino with the command ``RunPythonScript." The script will then ask them to select their 3D reef mesh. 

ASSUMPTIONS: 
*Reef mesh positioned with one corner of the quadrat at the origin, aligned with the positive X and Y-axes. 
*All of the model has positive Z-coordinates. 
*The “Top” plane is the construction plane. 
*Model units are meters. 

Values of fractal dimension will print in the Rhino command screen. They can be copied from here into a spreadsheet.
